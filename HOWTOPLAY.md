Overview
-----
It is a turn-based strategy game currently involving 2 players (I'm gonna take a stab at AI and/or putting it online later).

Each player starts with 1 "portal" (I'm working really hard to find terms here that don't sound incredibly nerdy, but there aren't any)
The goal of each player is to destroy the opponent's "portal"

This "portal" can "summon"/"teleport" "creatures"/"aliens" which can move and attack


(will explain the pictures in next commit)
