For the sake of explanation, I'm going to stop worrying about how horrifically nerdy the terms and game are.

Overview
-----
- There are 2 players
  - Player 1 has the white portal and beige (off-white) aliens
  - Player 2 has the blue portal and blue aliens




Goal
-----
- The game is basically capture the flag
  - kill the other player's portal before they kill yours.
- How? Attack the opponent's portal (with your aliens) until it runs out of health.
